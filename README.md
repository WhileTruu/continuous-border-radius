# Why?

A few days ago I saw this video on YouTube:
[Apple Design: The twenty pixels that changed design forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YElVQqNwrJ4).
I didn't know that _that_ was the secret sauce. The corners on a lot of Apple
stuff _do_ look a lot better than border radius, and I couldn't unsee it.

I started wondering if I could have these corners on the web, everywhere, on any
element. And this is that attempt.

The great resources I used:
https://www.jayfreestone.com/writing/cutouts-css-masks/ - the idea to use masks, although the exact method didn't work for me, leaving artifacts at the edges.
https://liamrosenfeld.com/posts/apple_icon_quest/ - a lot of good maths
